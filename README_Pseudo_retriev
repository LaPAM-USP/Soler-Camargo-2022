Soler-Camargo et al, 2022. The rate and role of pseudogenes of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex

INPUT files:

1 - The gbff and cds.fna files of each genome downloaded from NCBI.

Add the files in a directory with the Pseudo_retriev.py algorithm and run the following command:

python3 Pseudo_retriev.py

OUTPUT files:

1 - The ".fasta" file that contains the nucleotide sequences of all pseudogenes without pseudogenes in the 3' and 5' ends of contigs predicted by PGAP of NCBI. 2 - The ".txt" file that contains the count of pseudogenes at 3' and 5' ends of contigs and the remaining pseudogenes.

NOTES:

The gbff and fna files must have the exactly same name.

We recommend to not change the name of the files downloaded from NCBI.

Do not add any other .gbff or .fna files in the directory.

You may run this algorithm for all analyzed genomes at once.

The algorithm accepts complete and incomplete (draft) genomes.

The algorithm shows the number of pseudogenes before and after curation of each strain.
